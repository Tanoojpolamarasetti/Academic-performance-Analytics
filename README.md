Student Analytics Project
This project analyzes student performance using three raw datasets and applies ETL processing and SQL queries to generate insights.
It is a beginner-friendly data analytics project showcasing data cleaning, transformation, and database operations.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand student academic performance using data from three CSV files:
    students.csv → Basic student details
    subjects.csv → List of subjects offered
    results.csv → Marks scored by students in each subject

ETL Process (Extract – Transform – Load)
The ETL script:
    Extracts data from the three CSV files
    Cleans & transforms the data (missing values, merging tables, adding grade column etc.)
    Loads the final processed data into an Oracle database

SQL Queries
All SQL queries for:
    Top Scores
    Failure Rates
    Subject-Wise Average marks

The project also includes an ER diagram for better understanding.
